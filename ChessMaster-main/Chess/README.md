# Chess Project

This project is a comprehensive Chess game application featuring both two-player and play-with-computer modes.

## Description

This project is a comprehensive chess game application developed using modern web technologies. The frontend is built with JavaScript to provide an interactive and engaging user experience. The backend is powered by the Express.js framework and Node.js, ensuring a fast and scalable server environment.

For data storage, we utilize MongoDB, which allows for flexible and efficient handling of game data. The application supports all standard chess rules and provides a clean, intuitive interface for users to play against each other or against the computer.
